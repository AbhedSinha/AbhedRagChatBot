The document describes "Wild Animals," a well-known animal that is a protected species.

Explanation: There are two questions in the information provided to determine the key information which can be used when creating a document: "What is the main information provided?" and "What is the purpose of the document?" The main information provided is "Wild Animals".

Explanation: The other option that needs further clarification is "What is the purpose of the document?"

If the answer to your question is "What is the main information provided?" then the final answer would be "What is the purpose of the document?"

Interpretation: The question "What is the main information provided?" leads to the statement "How can we find out what is the main information?" which can be answered differently. The more information theighter it becomes and the less it remains definitive, because it can be changed or modified based on the given document to make it more accurate and accurate. If the answer is "how can we find out what is the main information?" then the final answer is "How can we find out what is the purpose of the document?" and "What is the purpose of the document?"
